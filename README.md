# HR_Data_Analytics-PowerBI
 
* Using the HR Data file, I have loaded, transformed, cleaned and created a template using Power Query for organizing the employee data for understanding employee attendance, leave and wfh habbits to derive  better insights and plan utilisation of resources accordingly.

* With the help of data that has been cleaned and the the template, I made measures and other columns that help with generating a report/dashboard in Power BI using DAX.

* And finally, using the required data I have created the dashboard for Employee Attendance Behaviour.
